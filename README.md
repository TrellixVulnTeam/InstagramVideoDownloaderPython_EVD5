The program nain.py is a simple script in python which downloads a video from a video url link 
provided by user and saves it in the file system as "newvideo.mp4". Ongoing progress
in main2.py and main3.py is to modify it into a streamlit application which can easily be hosted. 
main2.py and main3.py are incomplete and will be updated as soon as they are
